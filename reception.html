                                according to
                                video game review aggregator Metacritic.
                                It became the Nintendo 64's top seller during the 1999 holiday season and Nintendo's
                                chief
                                defense against competitor Sega's introduction of its Dreamcast console.
                                As a bestseller, Donkey Kong 64 joined Nintendo's "Player's Choice" game selection,
                                where
                                high sales continued through the next holiday season.
                                By 2004, more than 2.3 million units had been sold in North America. It won the 1999 E3
                                Game
                                Critics award for Best Platform Game, and several annual awards from Nintendo Power,
                                including best overall game of 1999.
                                It was additionally nominated for "Game of the Year" and "Console Game of the Year"
                                during
                                the 3rd Annual AIAS Interactive Achievement Awards (now known as the D.I.C.E. Awards).
                                GamePro named it an "Editor's Choice".
                                IGN described Donkey Kong 64 as the biggest and most ambitious Nintendo 64 game as of
                                its
                                release, but very similar to Banjo-Kazooie in its platforming and puzzle design.
                                Similarities between the two games was a common refrain. Overall, reviewers were more
                                impressed by its visuals than by its other elements, such as gameplay. </p>

                            <p class="text-white">Reviewers criticized or had little praise for the game's emphasis on
                                collecting items and backtracking—"an interactive egg hunt". This had become a trend in
                                Rare's games, and Donkey Kong 64 followed the "predictable formula" of making players
                                collect multiple sets of items and in full for a special ending. Next Generation noted
                                Rare's propensity for backtracking. GameSpot more diplomatically assumed that players
                                who liked collecting items would be titillated by its replay value, and those who did
                                not would be frustrated by its chores. The Cincinnati Enquirer applauded the minigames
                                as a "welcome diversion [which] add to the fun of an already massive adventure", and
                                which are so good they would have worked as their own released games on
                                previous-generation consoles. EGM said the puzzles and minigames are fun the first time
                                through, but they quickly become worn when replayed with increasingly tighter time
                                restrictions. GameSpot, however, considered parts of Donkey Kong 64's gameplay
                                "cerebral", requiring the consideration of several simultaneous tasks to solve later
                                puzzles. Already familiar with concepts borrowed from Super Mario 64, Ocarina of Time,
                                and Banjo-Kazooie, critics considered the player's tasks less innovative or interesting
                                to decipher. In retrospective reviews, Nintendo Life described the chore of collecting
                                objects "excessive" and repetitive. They suggested that backtracking, for instance,
                                could be reduced by letting the player switch between characters at any time. </p>

                                hours in basic gameplay, IGN called it Rare's War and Peace. GameFan wrote that "big" is
                                an understatement, and "the adventure found within is mastodonic". Writers from AllGame
                                and EGM became frequently lost or distracted in its world. The ingenuity of the boss
                                battles, particularly the final battle against K. Rool, was highlighted, although the
                                story's ending disappointed EGM. Reviewers found little entertainment in the multiplayer
                                mode but praised the gameplay variety between the five characters. The controls also
                                frustrated reviewers, between slow movement speed and camera angle issues. For example,
                                characters who become unresponsive during their attack animations are vulnerable to
                                encroaching enemies. Edge wrote that the lack of camera improvements over Banjo-Kazooie
                                was inexcusable. </p>
