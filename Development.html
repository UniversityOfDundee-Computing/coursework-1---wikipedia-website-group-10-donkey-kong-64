        <p>Following its success with the Donkey Kong Country games in the mid-1990s, developer Rare built its next Donkey Kong game on its predecessors' gameplay but not as a direct sequel.[15] Rare's Gregg Mayles led the effort to create Donkey Kong 64.[16] Development began in 1997—shortly after the completion of Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble! (1996)[17]— intended for release on the Nintendo 64's 64DD floppy disk drive add-on.[18][19] It was transitioned to cartridge after the 64DD was delayed and eventually canceled.[20] A team of 16 people worked on the game across three years, and an additional eight members assisted in its later stages.[2][17] Many developers transitioned from Rare's Banjo team, which had worked on Banjo-Kazooie (1998) and Banjo-Tooie (2000).[21] Donkey Kong 64 was built atop the Banjo game engine</p>
